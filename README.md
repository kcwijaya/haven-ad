# Overview

Introduces users to our team name and a short blurb: 
Haven is a soon to be launched mobile application geared towards coordinating efforts to help communities recover after emergencies and natural disasters. It works as a platform that connects organizations, victims, bystanders, and members of the community to unite in this shared goal. With its intuitive interface and tageted features, it will change the landscape of crisis management on the global scape. 
**We welcome you to join us in this effort**.

Also allows users to like or share on facebook. Clicks to these are monitored by our custom analytics and trackers. 

# Features

This area discusses three of the features of our application:

** Task Deployment and Announcements ** 

Relief organizations, government agencies, victims, and members of the community can list and describe either tasks that need to be completed or general announcements. These can range from the work that needs to be done after relief organizations are instructed to leave the region; victims that need assistance in finding food or shelter; to families or companies that are organizing stations to distribute resources. Task completion progress and help station conditions are carefully tracked to ensure that there are no stale information or miscommunication.


**User Profiles and Verification**

In order to ensure that you only see the tasks and notes pertinent to you, user profiles are used to track what jobs would best suit your skills and what notes or announcements address your needs. Through Haven, you can precisely track the impact you have made in your community and how your community has helped you. User verification ensures that tasks and announcements that appear on Haven can and should be followed. 


**Geospatial Capabilities**

Haven not only allows neighbors and communities to work together to recover after a disaster, but also prepares communities for future ones. By analyzing hot spots, movements, and resource needs, Haven can be a significant asset in future crisis preparedness.
